				<h1>THE TOMMY BAHAMA FAMILY</h1>
				<p>In 1992, Tony Margolis, Bob Emfield and Lucio Dalla Gasperina pooled all of their talents and launched their first collection of Tommy Bahama Menswear. From the on-set they had in mind a different way of approaching fashion and created clothes around how they liked to live and put the whole line on vacation.  To celebrate the best part of the week, the weekend and to make clothes that transport us to an island state of mind.  This island lifestyle became a way to express our creativity, our dedication to authentic quality and came to life as Tommy Bahama.</p>
				<p>Tommy Bahama has since become an entire experience with ranges of clothing, accessories, food, rum and home furnishings.  It’s a whole collection of products, with expanded lines to take you through the ebb and flow of each day and year round. From the beach to elegant evenings out on the town, the subtle textures and refined finishes are carefully considered, meticulously crafted and infused with island life.</p>

				<h1>AS SEEN IN NAPLES ILLUSTRATED</h1>
				<br/><p>One Long Weekend</p>
				<br/><p>Two fashion veterans used Naples to make casual clothes a “rumaway” hit by creating Tommy Bahama.  Naples Illustrated recently talked with two of the company’s three founders – Bob Emfield and Tony Margolis – over lunch at the company’s Naples restaurant, their first and most successful enterprise and a wellspring for such pressing matters as how to feed your alter ego, what to wear during the summer, and why flexibility is important in business as well as fashion.</p>
				<p>Tommy Bahama is more than a brand.  He’s a personality who lives in his own world.  With abundant leisure time, a free spirit, and an adequate trust fund to lubricate his interests, this Florida-based creative enjoys the good life without being anchored by possessions.  If he has any emotional baggage, there’s a big hole in it.</p>
				<p>Tony Margolis, Bob Emfield, and Lucio Dalla Gasperina, creators of Tommy’s parallel fictional retail/dining/lifestyle universe, were deeply inspired by their own Gulf Coast experiences when creating a company focused on casual wear that was comfortable, versatile, and timeless.  They not only created a new brand in a saturated market, they also unleashed the inner Tommy in men everywhere.</p>
				<p>“We all have our own version of Tommy,” says Margolis, who spends his winters in Naples.  “I think it’s always been there.  People have always had a fantasy escape.  We tried to find a way to bring that fantasy world into your everyday life.”</p>
				<p>That world is embodied in the Third Street South Tommy Bahama compound in Naples – the first in the company – where retail and restaurant create an environment that makes it easy to relax and hard to leave.  In addition to showcasing clothing for men and women, home furnishings, watches, linen, rugs, eyewear, and beer are just a few of the many accessories being sold to maintain the perpetual vacation lifestyle.  Even in places far from the Tropics, Tommy Bahama store and restaurants capture that universal yearning for a life that revolves around lounging, sailing, dancing, and other moments in the sun.</p>
				<br/><p>Tommy: The Windfall Wizard</p>
				<br/><p>The saga of Tommy Bahama has its origin just north of Collier County on Bonita Beach, where Emfield and his late wife, Jan, bought a condominium 30 years ago, and convinced Bob’s colleague and good friend Margolis to invest in the nascent housing market of Southwest Florida.  Bob and Jan, who met at Kent State University and spent spring breaks along Florida’s legendary East Coast, had decided that the slower pace and smaller cities of Florida’s West Coast better suited them.  Starting from the Tampa area, the couple spent several vacations working their way down the coast until they checked into the Cove Inn on Naples Bay and found their condo.</p>
				<p>“We knew this is what we wanted to do and where we wanted to be,” Emfield recalls.  “We just couldn’t get comfortable with the East Coast.”</p>
				<p>The story goes that when Emfield and Margolis and their wives vacationed, they developed the Tommy Bahama persona as they were leaving their island paradise, imagining that they would like to be this person who didn’t have to work, but who lived his life as one long weekend.  Eventually, as Tommy developed, the clothing industry veterans couldn’t help but imagine what their hero would wear.</p>
				<br/><p>Comfort Level</p>
				<br/><p>During his career in retail, Margolis found comfort was lacking in men’s fashion.  Margolis remembers having to have a hat when he went on sales calls for Manhattan Shirt Co. in the late 1960’s.  He didn’t sell hats, didn’t even wear them, but his clients did, and he soon learned how multidimensional and dynamic the retail fashion industry was.</p>
				<p>Leisure/sports apparel quickly abandoned hats and other constrictions, opening the market for emerging apparel brands that suggested a new lifestyle could be obtained by simply switching shirts.</p>
				<p>After working together at companies including Brittania and Generra Sportswear Co., Margolis and Emfield began actively working on a concept for upscale casual menswear and set out to create a believable persona to market it.  They had an image of a seasoned man who loved the sun, but without having to don loud Hawaiian shirts.  Tommy liked all activities tropical – fishing, golf, boating, relaxing, dining outside – and wanted clothes for each pursuit.  In 1992, Margolis became CEO of the newly formed clothing importer Viewpoint International.  Emfield, who had been a regional sales manager at Generra, became marketing director, and Dalla Gasperina, who worked as vice president for Union Bay Sport, was made design director of Viewpoint.  The team decided to combine their experience and knowledge to create a brand that suited their vacation lifestyle in Southwest Florida.</p>
				<p>As a result, they began a venture that would change how men aged 25 to 60 look at shopping and themselves.</p>
				<p>After struggling to convince major retailers to carry their brand, the group found success among specialty shops during a time when the emerging Internet threatened all traditional businesses.  The company grew to 2,000 accounts, eventually landing stores like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus.</p>
				<p>The team felt it was time to open their own retail location, and they had the perfect spot – Naples, where Margolis and Emfield had vacationed for so many years.  Their Third Street South compound would soon become very busy helping people relax.</p>
				<p> “This is our sweet spot.  This is the perfect community for what we do,” says Margolis, clad in a striped Tommy Bahama shirt with light khakis.  Just like Tommy, he’s a regular at the tropical restaurant, with its Bermuda shutters and tasty casual fare.  “The truth was, you couldn’t get a decent burger in town.  We were sort of out in the street, lost.”</p>
				<p>Before they opened their first retail store in 1995, space next to it became available.  So in typical carefree Tommy Bahama fashion, the partners dove into two of the most hazardous ventures in American business:  fashion and restaurant, creating Tommy Bahama Tropical Cafe and Emporium.  The island-style restaurant is a destination, the only place to enjoy Tommy Bahama beer and purchase a silk camp shirt.  Their ability to capture crossover clients with retail restaurants and maintain their interest turned out to be an excellent model, one that has caught on.</p>
				<p> “There’s a totally different edge about everything we did,” says Emfield, clad in jeans and sneakers, his long-sleeved denim shirtsleeves rolled up, like Tommy, of course.  “From a fashion standpoint, it’s a totally American look.  It didn’t look like anything that had been done.  It gave us a big field to play in.”</p>
				<br/><p>Rum Away</p>
				<br/><p>As the company and the brand continues to grow, research for the company’s next move can mean sipping tropical drinks and watching the sunset in order to conjure their inner Tommy, who is always just a rumrunner away.  Certainly there are stormy days, but most are washed away with a cool drink as each decision they make is posed the same way:  What would Tommy do?  Besides dabbling in yacht brokerage and ceiling fans, does he really wear socks and ties?
				<br/>“He’d wear a tie to meet his financial planner,” Margolis says.
				<br/>“No, he wouldn’t,” Emfield counters.
				<br/>“We sell ties,” Margolis says.  “He’d wear one.”
				<br/>“It would be on his car seat,” Emfield says.  The banter between them is a valuable asset.  The three partners are good enough friends to disagree once in awhile and give each other a different perspective.  Margolis and Emfield spend much of their time on the East Coast of the United States while Dalla Gasperina stays near the company headquarters on the West Coast.  According to Emfield, that separation is a plus because their get-togethers are a real event.  Twice a year they meet at a restaurant and taste-test the menu.  Last December, all three were bird hunting in Georgia without any talk of business.</p>
				<p>“A lot of the reason we’ve been as successful as we have is that the three of us don’t see things the same way,” Emfield says.  “I think the three of us have an absolute respect for each other’s opinion.  We haven’t had an argument in 14 years.”</p>
				<p>“It’s not that we were so clear-sighted in what we wanted to do,” Margolis says.  They know that making adjustments can be more important than making mistakes.  They see the things that need improvement.  Even if the original ideas weren’t good ones, it’s obvious they were thinking beyond that position.</p>
				<p>In order to bring men into the store, the persona of Tommy was the vehicle for unique combinations of fabrics and colors.  Silk helped separate the brand from the competition, but the fit was different too, and the patterns weren’t wild enough to be faddish.  Quality was critical, because guys want to wear their favorite shirt as much as possible.  For cooler weather, there’s even the Aruba sweatshirt.  Tommy might occasionally snow ski, but his fashion foundation would still be a T-shirt.</p>
				<p>Ideas flow from the team like draft beer.  It certainly helps to have the conscience of Tommy looking over them to guide their most capricious endeavors, but sound business practices also keep them grounded.  There are no sales or discounts in the retail stores, although the company recently opened a few outlet shops.  The company’s newest store at Coconut Point in Estero had the fourth largest sales in the chain one day in January.</p>
				<p>“We consciously made a garment that lived up to the customer’s expectations,” Margolis says.  “Men get favorite garments and favorite brands.  Guys kind of get into a box they’re comfortable in and stay with it.  It’s not too extreme; it’s not over the top.”</p>
				<br/><p>Island Time</p>
				<br/><p>What started as a way to feed their families has become a concept that customers have latched onto with the same passion Tommy has for windsurfing.  Stories include tales of the country club manager who buys 90 shirts each year, or the family who made quilts using their departed brother’s Tommy Bahama shirts.</p>
				<p>When Jan Emfield fought breast cancer in the early 1990’s, the idea of starting a new company was difficult for Bob.  It was a tough battle for her, but when she died in the 1994, Tommy Bahama turned out to be more than a mere distraction.</p>
				<p>“I was going to pull out,” Emfield recalls.  “I thought it would be best.  She said, ‘That would be a tremendous mistake.  You’re going to need this after I’m gone.’  She was right.”</p>
				<p>The nature of the company and the support of his partners were invaluable in his grieving process.  As a tribute to her spirit, the company has focused corporate giving on the Garden of Hope and Courage, an oasis of life and beauty for people fighting illness in hospitals.  The first garden was dedicated last fall at Naples Community Hospital, and provides a place where thriving plants give patients, families, and health workers a place to find peace or to be uplifted.  The company hopes to take the garden concept nationwide.  In addition, each store hosts a golf tournament to raise money for a local charity.</p>
				<p>Tommy Bahama is more than a brand.  He’s a personality who lives in his own world.  As Tommy grows older, he has been slowing down a little bit.  “Lately, he’s been playing a lot of competitive bridge,” Emfield says, laughing.  The company was acquired by Oxford Industries in 2003, while the three partners continue to steer the company toward new horizons.  They got out of the yacht business, but plan to launch a rum line in June.</p>
				<p>It can be difficult to discern where Tommy leaves off and his gregarious creators begin, but those ponderings are better suited for the next happy hour.  Somewhere in the world, it’s Island Time.
				<br/>“I keep telling people Manhattan is an island,” Margolis says.
				<br/>“So is Ireland,” Emfield adds.</p>
				<p>The irony is that laid-back, relaxed Tommy still keeps Emfield and Margolis very busy.  They didn’t realize what they had created until one week after the first restaurant opened in Naples.  When they saw people waiting two hours to enter their lighthearted land for a taste of something new, it was the dawn of a new world.  As veterans of the fashion industry, the ability to make the shift to restaurants is a proud accomplishment for all of them, but how would Tommy maintain his handicap?</p>
				<p>“We thought were going to work six months and play golf six months,” Margolis says.  “I gave up golf.”  NI</p>

				<h1>THE GARDEN OF HOPE AND COURAGE</h1>
				<p>The principals behind Tommy Bahama are committed to extending the relaxed, positive vibe of the brand into philanthropic efforts.  The company’s participation in the Garden of Hope and Courage is an example of this commitment.</p>
				<p>The wife of one of the founders of Tommy Bahama, Janet Emfield, battled breast cancer.  During her struggle, she envisioned a peaceful garden in the midst of a sterile hospital setting — a place of tranquility and solace for cancer patients, their families and health care providers.  As an avid gardener, Emfield recognized the physical and psychological healing benefits that a natural garden setting could provide.  The Garden of Hope and Courage is dedicated to bringing the healing power of gardens to hospitals across the country.</p>
				<p>The organization has several goals in addition to paying tribute to those who have fought against breast cancer: to increase public awareness of the disease, to provide current information about early detection and treatment, and to raise money for breast cancer research.</p>
				<p>For all those who seek a place of sanctuary, a place of quiet, a place of beauty and of life, there is the Garden of Hope and Courage.  Inspired by the great courage of women faced with breast cancer, as well as all who have been touched by cancer; and in memory of sons, daughters, husbands, and dear friends, the garden serves as a living testament to courage, compassion, hope and love.</p>
