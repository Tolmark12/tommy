ITEM::
27-Aug) I think that now that I am using the Item object, that some of the if functionality is broken...
28-Aug) Actually, the functionality is fine, it just need real xml data loaded into it. 

TODO:

1) Build logic for clicking next buttons to view...
2) Build drag-bar for changing size of cards
3) finish dropDown

*It would be nice to make the card class more robust
* I'd like to create a business class that draws a jaggedy "paper" bg

DATABASE INTEGRATION:
In what way should the product be requested. I'd like to make this sort of a call:

-   getTops( 'brand' );


// What options are available per product type?
-   getProductDetails( 'productId' )

return: sizing, colors, price, what else?
// How are the colors handled? seperate products with their own sizing options?
